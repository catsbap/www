This folder contains the starter HTML template files. They were moved here so as to not clutter and confuse the working directory.

Once an HTML file has been "php-ified", it (the original HTML file) should be moved to this directory.

The stylesheet(s) and jQuery libraries were copied here incase it is necessary to view the HTML templates for reference, experimenting, or testing changes in HTML without PHP being involved.
